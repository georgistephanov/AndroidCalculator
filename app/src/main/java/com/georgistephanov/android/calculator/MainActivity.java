/**
 * I started this project as my first android app project in order to start
 * learning android development. I will aim to write a fully functional
 * calculator with the basic functionality and a pleasant UI. Hopefully,
 * I'll be able to finish this app within less than two weeks, but in the worst
 * case scenario, I would want this app finished by 13th of December.
 *
 * Project started on: 25-Nov-2017
